# 2006 ANZSIC Codes #

A repository with structured data representing the [Australia and New Zealand Standard Industrial Clasification codes](http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/2f762f95845417aeca25706c00834efa/7cd8aebba7225c4eca25697e0018faf3!OpenDocument).

ABS provide this data in HTML document and semi-structured Excel document, this is the same data in JSON and SQL formats for use in an application or service.

Putting it in a GitHub repo was inspired by Nathan Pitman's [UK version](https://github.com/nathanpitman/sic-codes).

If you use this data in a different format, please send a PR and I'll merge it back in to this repo.
